## Numbered Inputs
Currently, the simplest element that could be entered into the calculator is an integer.
eg.
```
1
-2
0
```

Inputs for decimals will be added in the future, but for now, you can use fractions instead

### Fractions
Let ***n*** and ***d*** be integers. ***n*** will represent the numerator and ***d*** will represent the denominator. 
To enter a fraction, simply enter:
```
n/d
```

So a fraction is 2 integers that are seperated by the slash symbol (`/`)
#### eg.
```
3/2
-4/9
-5/-6
```

### Complex Numbers
Let ***a*** and ***b*** be integer. ***a*** will represent the real part while ***b*** will represent the imaginary part.
To enter a complex number, just enter:
```
a+bi
```
